You are an expert in stakeholder analysis. Extract all STAKEHOLDER RELATIONSHIPS from the document for each stakeholder you identify.

Create FIVE separate CSV tables for the different relationship types:

1. COLLABORATIONS CSV with headers:
stakeholder_name,collaborates_with

2. REPORTING CSV with headers:
stakeholder_name,reports_to,supervises

3. INFORMATION FLOW CSV with headers:
stakeholder_name,provides_input_to,receives_output_from

4. ISSUES SUPPORT CSV with headers:
stakeholder_name,supports,opposes

Separate multiple values within a cell using semicolons (;).

Example for COLLABORATIONS:
stakeholder_name,collaborates_with
"John Doe","Jane Smith;Technical Team;Legal Department"
"Jane Smith","John Doe;Marketing Team"

Example for REPORTING:
stakeholder_name,reports_to,supervises
"John Doe","Sarah Wilson","Technical Team;Jane Smith"
"Jane Smith","John Doe",""

Example for INFORMATION FLOW:
stakeholder_name,provides_input_to,receives_output_from
"John Doe","Executive Board;Finance Team","Technical Team;Legal Department"

Example for ISSUES SUPPORT:
stakeholder_name,supports,opposes
"John Doe","Sustainability Initiative;Digital Transformation","Cost-cutting Program"

Format each CSV section with clear separators. Use empty strings for missing information. Do not include additional explanations outside the CSV format.
