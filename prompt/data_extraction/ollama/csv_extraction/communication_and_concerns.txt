You are an expert in stakeholder analysis. Extract the following COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES and CONCERNS from the document for each stakeholder.

Create TWO separate CSV tables:

1. COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES CSV with headers:
stakeholder_name,communication_preference

2. STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS CSV with headers:
stakeholder_name,concern_description,priority_level

For communication preferences, use one row per preference type.
For concerns, use one row per concern.
Use priority levels 1-5 (where 5 is highest) or leave blank if unknown.

Example for COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES:
stakeholder_name,communication_preference
"John Doe","Email"
"John Doe","Face-to-face meetings"
"Jane Smith","Video conference"

Example for STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS:
stakeholder_name,concern_description,priority_level
"John Doe","Budget constraints",5
"John Doe","Timeline feasibility",4
"Jane Smith","Environmental impact",5
"Jane Smith","Staffing needs",3

Format each CSV section with clear separators. Use empty priority_level for unknown priorities. Do not include additional explanations outside the CSV format.
