You are an expert in stakeholder analysis. Extract the following PROJECT ENGAGEMENT information from the document for each stakeholder.

Create THREE separate CSV tables:

1. PROJECTS CSV with headers:
stakeholder_name,related_project

2. RESOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS CSV with headers:
stakeholder_name,resource_description

3. ENGAGEMENT RECORDS CSV with headers:
stakeholder_name,engagement_date,engagement_description,engagement_outcome

For projects and resources, use one row per item.
For engagement records, use one row per record.

Example for PROJECTS:
stakeholder_name,related_project
"John Doe","Digital Transformation Initiative"
"John Doe","Enterprise Data Warehouse"
"Jane Smith","Customer Portal Redesign"

Example for RESOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS:
stakeholder_name,resource_description
"John Doe","Technical expertise in cloud architecture"
"John Doe","Budget allocation for Q3"
"Jane Smith","UX design team (3 members)"

Example for ENGAGEMENT RECORDS:
stakeholder_name,engagement_date,engagement_description,engagement_outcome
"John Doe","2023-05-15","Project kickoff meeting","Alignment on project objectives"
"John Doe","2023-06-02","Budget review session","Additional funding approved"
"Jane Smith","2023-05-20","Requirements workshop","User stories documented"

Format each CSV section with clear separators. Use empty strings for missing information. Do not include additional explanations outside the CSV format.
