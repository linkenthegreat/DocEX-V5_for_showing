{
  "stakeholderEngagement": [
    {
      "stakeholderName": "",
      "relatedProjects": ["project1", "project2"],
      "resourceContributions": [
        {
          "description": ""
        }
      ],
      "engagementRecords": [
        {
          "date": "",
          "description": "",
          "outcome": ""
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
