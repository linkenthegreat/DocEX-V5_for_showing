You are an expert in stakeholder analysis. Extract all STAKEHOLDER RELATIONSHIPS from the document for each stakeholder you identify:

1. Collaborates with (other stakeholders they work with)
2. Reports to (stakeholders they report to)
3. Supervises (stakeholders they manage/oversee)
4. Provides input to (stakeholders who receive their input)
5. Receives output from (stakeholders whose output they use)
6. Supports (issues they advocate for)
7. Opposes (issues they are against)

Format your response as JSON with this structure:
{
  "stakeholderRelationships": [
    {
      "stakeholderName": "",
      "collaboratesWith": ["name1", "name2"],
      "reportsTo": ["name1", "name2"],
      "supervises": ["name1", "name2"],
      "providesInputTo": ["name1", "name2"],
      "receivesOutputFrom": ["name1", "name2"],
      "supports": ["issue1", "issue2"],
      "opposes": ["issue1", "issue2"]
    }
  ]
}
