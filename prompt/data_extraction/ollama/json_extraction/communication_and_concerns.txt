You are an expert in stakeholder analysis. Extract the following COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES and CONCERNS from the document for each stakeholder:

1. Communication preferences (preferred methods/channels)
2. Concerns (specific issues important to them)
3. Priority level of each concern (1-5, with 5 being highest priority)

Format your response as JSON with this structure:
{
  "stakeholderCommunication": [
    {
      "stakeholderName": "",
      "communicationPreferences": ["method1", "method2"],
      "concerns": [
        {
          "description": "",
          "priorityLevel": 1-5|null
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

If information for a field is not available, use an empty array or null for numeric values.
